<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Meijeevan K T, a tech enthusiast and budding web developer with a deep passion for IoT, VLSI, and space technology. Currently a student with a background in high achievement (94.3 percentile in JEE Mains) and hands-on project experience, I’m on a journey to merge creativity with technology to craft solutions that matter.

  I’m currently immersed in learning web development, Python, MATLAB, and LTspice. I’ve honed my skills through events like Technovit at VIT Chennai, where I worked on web applications, experimented with 3D models, and explored defense technology. Through projects like an OTP-based smart locking system and smart home automation, I’m gaining practical experience in IoT while refining my programming and electronics expertise.</p>
  
 <p> In addition to my technical pursuits, I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing creativity and a positive atmosphere to every project. With 500+ LinkedIn connections and an active GitHub presence, I’m building my network and exploring opportunities in freelancing. I’m here to grow, create, and contribute to impactful projects in the world of technology.
